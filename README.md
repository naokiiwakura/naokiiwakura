# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! With over 10 years of experience in software development, I have worked on various projects with diverse technologies. Previously, I worked at Pipefy as a Full Stack Software Engineer, where I gained significant experience in Ruby on Rails and React. My main specialty, however, is with the .NET framework, and I can adapt quickly to new technologies and best practices. In my past experience, I've also worked with Java, Spring, Hibernate, and Criteria Query language for a few months, as well as Pascal and Delphi 7 as an intern at the beginning of my career. My focus is on staying versatile and understanding all possible technologies, as the job market is constantly demanding new knowledge. While I wouldn't claim to be an expert given the ever-evolving nature of our industry, I consider myself a skilled developer. Currently, I am working at Pacer, where I continue to build on my expertise.
